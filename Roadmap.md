# 🛣️ Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the major milestones and planned development phases for the IoT-AI Public Safety project.

---

## ✨ Vision

Deliver a robust, intelligent emergency response solution for high-density tourist areas—minimizing delays, false alarms, and confusion with a blend of IoT hardware, AI-driven verification, and proximity-based notification.

---

## 🚩 Milestones

### ✅ Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Current)
- [x] Project repo created and setup
- [x] ESP32 firmware (basic button press, Wi-Fi alert)
- [x] Minimal Firebase backend (alert receipt/storage)
- [x] Simple web dashboard (alert visualization)
- [ ] Write documentation (README, Setup Guide, Roadmap)

---

### 🏗 Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [ ] Enhance firmware (LED/buzzer feedback, GPS location, 2-step activation)
- [ ] Advanced cloud backend logic (timestamp, device ID, area data)
- [ ] Integrate simple AI/rule-based alert validation
- [ ] Geo-fenced alerting to nearby users (Twilio SMS/call)
- [ ] Dashboard improvements (map view, filter/history)

---

### 🚀 Phase 3: Intelligence & Scale
- [ ] Upgrade AI/ML model for false alarm mitigation
